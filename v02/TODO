1) 
a - create a locl tun bucket where hash(local addr | local port) --> ipudp_dev_priv *
b - create a remote tun bucket for multiple tun devices
c - ipudp_4|6_rcv() first look up into the ltun bucket and retrieve the ipudp_dev receiving on this ltun
then look up into the rtun bucket. I need this for NAT traversal since I need to let some tunneled packet get to userspace
2) implement server/client for NAT traversal
3) remove socket reservation from kernel (sure?)
4) implement keepalive in userspace
